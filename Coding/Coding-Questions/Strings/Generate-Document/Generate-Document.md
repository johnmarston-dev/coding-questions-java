# Problem Description
You've given a string of available characters and a string representing a document that you need to generate. Write a function that determines if you can generate the document using the available characters. If you can generate the document, your function should return **true**; otherwise, it should return **false**.

You're only able to generate the document if the frequency of unique characters in the characters string is greater than or equal to the frequency of unique characters in the document string. For example, if you've given `characters = "abcabc"` and `document = "aabbccc"` you **cannot** generate the document because you're missing one `c`.

The document that you need to create may contain any characters, including special characters, capital letters, numbers, and spaces.

Note: you can always generate the empty string(`""`);

#### Sample Input
```java
characters = "Bste!hetsi ogEAxpelrt x "
document = "AlgoExpert is the Best!"
```

#### Sample Output
```java
true
```

# Solution
The idea behind this solution is quite simple, in order to generate the target document, each character in the **document** string should have a frequency that is smaller than or equal to the one in the **characters** string.Otherwise, we cannot generate the document.

Let's take a look at a sample solution that utilizes a **HashMap** to store frequencies of characters in the characters string.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Program {
	public boolean generateDocument(String characters, String document){
		// If the document is empty,return true
		// since no characters are needed to generate the document
		if(document.length() == 0){
			return true;
		}
		
		// Count and store the frequency of each character in the characters string
		HashMap<Character, Integer> characterFrequency = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
		for(char c : characters.toCharArray()){
			characterFrequency.put(c, characterFrequency.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
		}
		
		// Check if the characters string has enough characters to generate the document
		for(char c : document.toCharArray()){
			// Insufficient of character c to generate the document
			if(!characterFrequency.containsKey(c) || characterFrequency.get(c) <= 0){
				return false;
			}
			// Update frequency for the character that we've already seen
			characterFrequency.put(c, characterFrequency.get(c) - 1);
		}
		
		return true;
	}
}
```

# Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity:** The time complexity for this solution is **O(n + m)**, where n is the length of the characters string and m is the length of the document string.Since we only need to iterate over both the input strings once.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity for this solution is **O(c)**, where c is the number of unique characters in the characters string.

# Further Insights
We can absolutely solve this problem with **O(1)** space complexity, where we simply iterate over the document string, and for each character in the document string, we calculate its frequencies in both of the input strings.If that character has a smaller frequency in the characters string, that means we cannot generate the target document.The frequency-counting logic can be implemented like the following:

```java
private int countFrequency(char targetCharacter, String targetString){
	int frequency = 0;
	for(char c : targetString.toCharArray()){
		if(c == targetCharacter){
			frequency++;
		}
	}
	return frequency;
}
```

However, for each character in the document string, we need to call this method twice in order to get the frequencies, resulting in a **O(m * (n + m))** time complexity, where m is the length of the document string, and n is the length of the characters string.

This quadratic time complexity will cause potentially substantial performance issues with larger strings.Therefore, the advantage of minimal space complexity might be out-weighted by the decrease in performance.

Given those performance concerns, we utilized a hash table to achieve a linear time complexity of **O(n + m)**, while still maintaining a relatively minimal space complexity of **O(c)**.
